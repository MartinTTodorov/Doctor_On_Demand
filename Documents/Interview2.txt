Hello my name is Georgia school and I'm 22 years old and my colleague and I are doing a research for developing an application for finding medical help I want to ask you some a couple of questions are you OK with being recorded yes to begin with can you turn yourself to me till us a little bit more about yourself I know my name is basha savage I'm 21 years old a couple of months and negro currently starting at University of applied scientists to be Mars extra engineer and what they say when they're gonna they be want back to in developer go to bed so what you said where did you say you are from are you from the Netherlands or you're from above My guy how often do you experience inconvenience when trying to get in touch with a doctor well it's definitely more difficult than any of the neck I say I mean it could be just because I'm not familiar but I don't know how their system works but when I actually try to look up the system in Netherlands it gets quite confusing so someonewhat I've read I think is when you want to go to a general practition it's necessary your GP isn't necessarily the one closest to you but when I called the office or whatever clinic they tell me oh we get out have you we're full try to find somebody else so things like that get me really confused and I don't know what to do I understand and how do you how do you think these problems can be managed how do I think this problem can be made about we'll have more information should be put on Internet no there should be some kind of platform perhaps or just general information that's easily accessible to more people OK yeah because our idea now is to make a doctor and demand that which will be the following that you enter your location to the at home and North broadband and it will show you different categories for example you can choose a doctor for allergies doctor for electromatologists and so on and then you'll find them in the current city for the current category you've seen all the doctors available so you can see the appropriate rating and you can make an appointment So it could be helpful for a careful improvement for connection to you with your doctor I think this would definitely solve the most of the problems with the doctors in our independence and would you use this kind of application OK that's Minecraft definitely here's to the fact that you could have adopted or so easily accessible and that you actually know his rating and location and if the clinic is full or whatever I think it's ok thank you and do you have any suggestions towards us hope not really add so far may I basically explain to me the whole concept and so far I like this and maybe yeah what you said but like the idea do you turn on the door location And you can see the doctor's near you and you can also see every doctor and never clinic can you can basically specify if the clinic is full yes or no debt with the problem that I did encounter it's very early that I told you OK so you know if it's actually definitely useful or I'm scared pretty much that's it thank you very much have a nice day
